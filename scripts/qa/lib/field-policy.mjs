/**
 * FIELD VISIBILITY POLICY — one list, shared by every suite that has an opinion
 * about where a field should appear.
 *
 * Two suites ask overlapping questions:
 *   metadata-audit  reads the repo   — "is this field on a layout XML?"
 *   record-pages    drives the org   — "does this field render on the page?"
 *
 * They each started with their own waiver list and immediately disagreed: one
 * asserted a signing token must be OFF a layout while the other reported it as
 * missing. Two suites contradicting each other is worse than either being
 * wrong, because it makes the whole report unreliable. So the policy lives here
 * and both import it.
 *
 * Three categories, and the distinction matters:
 *
 *   ELSEWHERE — a real setting, edited through a purpose-built UI. Absent from
 *               the layout is fine; absent from BOTH would be a bug.
 *   ENGINE    — written by the engine, never by a person. Read-only noise on a
 *               layout; safe either way.
 *   FORBIDDEN — a secret. Being on a layout is itself the defect, and suites
 *               assert the OPPOSITE for these.
